A carpooling app, It matches members of the same community who can share one car in their rides.

How it works
------------------
1 - Join a community where you can find members near you to carpool with. Like your college, work, neighborhood.
2 - A member would post a ride either public or only to members of specified communities
3 - Another member would search for a ride getting the best matching rides. A good match is when the user searching is on the driver's way. Once the user requests to join one of those rides, the driver can accept or reject.

Features
-------------
- Log in with Facebook, G+, Linked-In
- Instant notifications for important events like getting request to join your ride, getting accepted in a ride...etc.
- Feedback system for the users. The feedback is collected after each ride the user participated in.
- In-App Chat with the option to send a location.
- Easy search for community to join or user to view his profile.
- Easy route entry(in posting or searching for a ride), either by picking from a map or searching by the address.
- Instant ride announcements, where one member of a ride can post an announcement so that the other members would be notified.
